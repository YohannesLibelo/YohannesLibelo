👋 **Hello! I'm Yohannes Libelo**

🎓 Final-year Honours student in Information Systems at the University of Cape Town. I’m passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and enhance user experiences.

🏆 **Winner of the 2024 Discovery Gradhack**: My team developed **SafeRoute**, a navigation app that enhances user safety by providing route recommendations based on real-time crime and load-shedding data. We believe this tool has the potential to make a real difference in people's daily lives.

💻 **Software Developer Intern**: Currently interning as part of my honours requirement, where I’m developing an AI-enabled coaching application that integrates Strava data to provide personalized workout recommendations. This project has honed my skills in full-stack development, using Spring Boot for the backend and Vue.js for the front end.

🌟 **Looking for Opportunities**: I am enthusiastic about securing a junior position where I can continue to grow and apply my skills. I bring a strong foundation in computer science and web development, with a passion for continuous learning, problem-solving, and attention to detail.

📈 **Current Projects**:
- **AI-Enabled Full-Stack Application**: Developing a coaching app that uses AI to provide workout recommendations based on user data. The project utilizes Spring Boot for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend.
